Summary:
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. There are major types: type 1 (insulin deficiency), type 2 (insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency), and gestational diabetes.
Prevention and management include healthy diets, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco use, and access to essential medicines and technologies (insulin, oral agents, blood glucose monitoring). Screening and treatment for complications (retinopathy, kidney disease, foot care) are essential.
WHO focuses on surveillance, guidelines, and global initiatives such as the Global Diabetes Compact and coverage targets for 2030.
