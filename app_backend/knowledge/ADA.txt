Summary:
Diabetes affects multiple body systems and requires patient-centered care including lifestyle interventions, glucose monitoring, medications (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists), and prevention of complications through cardiovascular risk reduction, blood pressure and lipid management.
ADA provides guidance on standards of care, self-management education, and resources for living with diabetes of different types.
